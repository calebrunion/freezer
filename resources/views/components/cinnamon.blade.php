<h1 id="cinnamon">Cinnamon</h1>
<p>When you find yourself at home
And Mom and dad are gone
Nothing else to do
Got the afternoon</p>
<p>We saw this new vine
We didn’t think twice
Gotta give it a try
So we roll the dice</p>
<p>Brody didn’t see it comin’
The smallest Runion
Time to realize our teenage authority</p>
<p>Then we opened up the cabinet
Brody couldn’t wait to have it
And we all fed him a spoon full&#39;a cinnamon</p>
<p>Cinnamon, cinnamon, cinnamon
Spoon full&#39;a cinnamon</p>
