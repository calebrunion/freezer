<p>Mary Frances,</p>
<p>By the life, death, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, I promise to give all of myself to you as your husband; to bind my heart, mind, and body to yours. By his name, I give you permission over myself. I will care for you, honor you, delight in you, only have eyes for you, and desire you everyday through the power of the Holy Spirit. I promise to believe in you. No sin will keep my affections from you. I will always forgive you. I will always be a home you can come back to. I will never give up on you. In spite of the circumstances, I will choose you. I will fight for us to live in the freedom which is ours in Christ. I will love you, Mary Frances. I am yours. </p>
