<h1 id="will-you-marry-me">Will You Marry Me?</h1>
<p>Fifteen
When I first met you
Your face
So beautiful in firelight
That night you caught my attention
(another line)
(another line)</p>
<p>Sixteen
I ordered a burrito
Chick-Fil-A
I left it in my car a long time
But you kept me from potential poisoning
I&#39;d probably not live to see today
If you were not so kind</p>
<p>Seventeen
Girl, I fell so hard for you
Your love for people took me by surprise
We sat down for coffee on our first date
And I was just dreaming of the day
I&#39;d have you by my side</p>
<p>Eighteen
I was sick on my bed about a year ago
You put up with my attitude, my smells
I know, I was so rude
Countless times I thought I didn&#39;t have a use..</p>
<p>But you looked at me and said that&#39;s not true
Boy, I hope that you know I love you</p>
<p>One year later
On this day
I can&#39;t imagine being more in love with you
So Mary, will you marry me?
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you</p>
